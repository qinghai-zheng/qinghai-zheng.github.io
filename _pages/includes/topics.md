## Multi-view Learning
I dedicate the majority of my time on <font color="red">Tensor-based Multi-view Learning </font>, mostly on clustering task (from a single task), unified representation learning task (for general tasks). I welcome any kinds of coopearations on this field. Do not hestiate to contact me. 

## Label Distribution Learning 
Another main focus of me is learning with label distributions. We have introduced several methods to achieve the goal of label enhancement, which can obtain label distributions from logical multi-labels.
