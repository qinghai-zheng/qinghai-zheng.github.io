<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am currently an assistant professor at [Fuzhou University](https://www.fzu.edu.cn/). 

I graduated from the [Shool of Software Engineering](https://se.xjtu.edu.cn/) of [Xi'an Jiaotong University](https://www.xjtu.edu.cn/) with a doctor degree, supervised by [Prof. Jihua Zhu]([https://english.nudt.edu.cn/](https://gr.xjtu.edu.cn/en/web/zhujh)). I joined the [Cognitive Systems and Information Processing Group](https://csip.fzu.edu.cn/) in [College of Computer and Data Science](https://ccds.fzu.edu.cn/) of Fuzhou University since 2022.03.14.

I am now working on ***Unsupervised Multi-view Learning*** and ***Label Distribution Learning***. Regarding the first topic, I dedicate the majority of my time on <font color="red">Tensor-based Multi-view Learning</font>, mostly on clustering task (from a single task), unified representation learning task (for general tasks). Another main focus of me is <font color="red">Label Enhancement</font>, we have introduced several interesting and promising label enhancement methods, which can obtain label distributions from logical multi-labels. 

I have published 30+ papers <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=GoV2wB0AAAAJ'><img src="https://img.shields.io/endpoint?logo=Google%20Scholar&url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.jsdelivr.net%2Fgh%2Fqinghai-zheng%2Fqinghai-zheng.github.io@google-scholar-stats%2Fgs_data_shieldsio.json&labelColor=f6f6f6&color=9cf&style=flat&label=citations"></a> at the top international AI conferences and journals, such as CVPR, AAAI, ACM MM, IEEE TKDE, and IEEE TCSVT. I also serve as reviewers for top conferences and journals, including CVPR, AAAI, ACM MM, IEEE TIP, IEEE TKDE, and IEEE TCSVT.

If you are seeking any form of ***academic cooperation***, please feel free to email me at [zhengqinghai@fzu.eud.cn](mailto:zhengqinghai@fzu.edu.cn).
